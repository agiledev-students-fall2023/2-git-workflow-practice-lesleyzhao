Software engineering article: https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/what-is/agile-development 

I found this article interesting because it illustrate what agile development is in the context of today's tech industry. It allows teammates to collaborate frequently on the same project, work on developing software quickly with sprint, and adapt to changes quickly in the collaboration. It also indicates the possible pros and cons for agile development and contrast it with other ways of software engineering, such as Kanban, XP, and Scrum.

Wow, this is an thorough introduction to Agile development for people have no experience with the method. As a student who learned Agile for two weeks, I still can benefit from this concise article!
